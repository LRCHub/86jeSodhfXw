All my favorite songs are slow
and sad
All my favorite people
make me mad
Everything that feels so good
is bad, bad, bad (Hey, hey)
All my favorite songs are slow
and sad
I don't know
what's wrong with me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know
what's wrong with me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I love parties, but I don't go
Then I feel bad when I stay home
'Cause I need a friend
when I take a walk
I like spacin' out
when somebody talks
I wanna be rich,
but I feel guilty
I fall in love with everyone
who hates me
All my favorite songs are slow
and sad
All my favorite people
make me mad (So mad)
Everything that feels so good
is bad, bad, bad (Hey, hey)
All my favorite songs are slow
and sad (All my favorite songs)
I don't know what's wrong
with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what's wrong
with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dreamy morning,
walkin' alone by myself
Thinkin' about life, and tryin'
to find my way through hell
Sometimes I wish
I was on an island (Ah, ah, ah)
But then I'd miss
the sound of sirens (Ah, ah, ah)
All my favorite songs are slow
and sad
All my favorite people
make me mad (So mad)
Everything that feels so good
is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow
and sad
I don't know
what's wrong with me
I don't know
what's wrong with me
I don't know
what's wrong with me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh, oh
